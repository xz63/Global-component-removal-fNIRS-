Global component remove program is made by Dr. Zhang, Xian,  Brain function lab, Yale school of medicine, Psychiatry department

Please site my paper: "Separation of the global and local components in functional near-infrared spectroscopy signals using principal component spatial filtering"
and "Signal processing of functional NIRS data acquired during overt speaking" ,which indicats the exist of global component in dexoyHb signal, while thought to be ignorable

for matlab run

GlobalRemover.demo

for python run

python global_reover.py

The demo program will show that for the oxyhemoglobal signal, global component removal eliminates the all positive correlation among channels.
